# TFG
TFG is my final degree project, the idea behind it is simple, there aren't a lot of ground based drones that work as security. The system has a few pieces, you need the hardware, the pc app and the android app. You can use either one of the apps to control the drones.
## Installation
In future you will be able to find the executable on the releases window.
## Usage
Ejecute the app and enjoy.
